Description: Mulset package allows for efficient computation of data distributions from highly inconsistent datasets with many missing values using multi-set intersections. Based upon hash functions, mulset can quickly identify intersections from very large matrices of input vectors across columns and rows and thus provides scalable solution for dealing with missing values. This package was published in Tomic et al, (2018)
